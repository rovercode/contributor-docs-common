rovercode
=====================================

Welcome to the rovercode contributor documentation! This documentation is about the creation of the rovercode
platform itself; if you are a teacher or student using rovercode, you're probably looking for
`rovercode.com <https://rovercode.com/>`_.

rovercode is made up of two main code bases:

- `rovercode <https://contributor-docs.rovercode.com/rovercode/development/index.html>`_: the service that runs on the rover
- `rovercode-web <https://contributor-docs.rovercode.com/rovercode/development/index.html>`_: the web application
