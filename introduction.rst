Introduction
================

rovercode is an open-source educational robotics platform. It consists of a hardware platform (the rover's chassis and 
`custom PCB <https://upverter.com/rovercode/>`_) and a software platform (services that run on the rover and in the cloud).
Did we mention that everything is open-source?

Students use our drag-and-drop code editor to create code that listens to the rover's sensors and controls its motors.

If you haven't checked out `rovercode.com <https://rovercode.com>`_, be sure to take a look. Otherwise, keep reading to 
learn more about helping to develop the rovercode platform.
